# Image-Classifier
Projects which use Face detection
This is very first project we are developing using Pythons face Detection library.

Functionality V0.1:
So this very first commit into master is to simplify the sorting of images in your presonal computer. Sometimes when we have many pictures in a folder and we want to sort the picture of yourself or any other person only, in this app you can provide a Sample image of the person for whom you want to classify or sort the images, then you can provide a optional folder name which will be created with all sorted or classified images in same directory in the folder name you have provided.

Currently the inputs you can provide in this app are:

  1. Name of the person (a new folder will be created with this name)
  2. Select Sample Image (which will be used to comapre rest of the images in the folder)
  3. Select Target folder which contains all unsorted images
  
  
Next improvments to be added:

Addding a progress bar which shows progress of the process of sorting Handling all negative-case scenarios and errors Currently the app is only compatible to Windows machine, so we need to make it compatible for Macos and Linux as well.

Installation:
you need to install Python 3.6, face_detection library, and cMake to run this project on your desktop.


Functionality V0.2:

      1. Added a Progress bar to show progress of classifying process
      2. Added a Stop button to stop processing and exit the programme
